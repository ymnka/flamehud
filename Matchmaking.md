The idea was to make a mock-up of a possible in-game interface for the TF2 developers to maybe help out competitive TF2 and make matchmaking and pugging a little bit more noob-friendly.

The first page would be the lobby where players could choose their class and team. I was contemplating adding a "Captains" section so the leader could choose captains and have them pick players based on the class they put in. Id imagine the games would be able to be set to public, invite only, or friends only.

The second page would be where the leader would input the settings for the pickup game. The advanced tab would be usable only by the leader since it would be where he would enter the server ip, rcon password, server connect password and possibly more advanced server settings such as sv\_pure settings, the max and min server rates and other commands.

The settings wouldn't be unchangeable in-game, it would just generate a basic playable configuration for a 6v6 or 9v9 or even 12v12 style of play without the use of league cfg files ie. rcon would still be usable by the server admin during the pug.

This would really help with the testing of new custom maps, as well as get new players interested in competitive-style gameplay without forcing them to jump on IRC or download third-party clients such as Mumble or Ventrilo.

These haven't been coded out, they're just mockups using photoshop.
