  * Shadows are a bit darker
  * Added separate installers for 16:10 and 16:9 ratios

## Updated December 17, 2009 ##
  * I messed up initially with the damage indicator. download IVFix
  * Made it work for the new Soldier Demo Update

## Updated December 10, 2009 ##
  * Added a patch to fix the broken HUD after the update.

## Updated December 2, 2009 ##

  * The background behind the health cross is now attached to the health file so you can move the whole thing by itself if you want and the overheal doesnt block the team color.
  * The Target ID numbers are now bigger as are the health crosses
  * The Spectator HUD is more toward the bottom due to it being annoying when it was above the cap points
  * The spy diguised as panel is now much cleaner looking
  * The health and ammo is now up higher toward the middle of the screen
  * There is a new 6v6 scoreboard not defaulted, which can be changed by renaming scoreboard.res to scoreboardpub.res and scoreboard6v6.res to scoreboard.res
  * The ubercharge number is much nicer looking and larger
  * The medic targetIDs are lower to make it less distracting while playing medic.

## Updated September 27, 2009 ##

  * There is a team colored border around your health cross so you know what team youre on
  * The Target ID is now colored based on what team you are on
  * The Spectator HUD is much smoother looking and out of the way as opposed to its normal overlapping positioning
  * A few fixes including the spy health value overlap.

## Whats Different ##

  * The Weapon Ammo Indicator is pushed in towards the center near the cap point icons
  * The Health Meter is now moved toward the center near the cap point icons with an easier font to read
  * The Target ID (Who youre looking at) now shows numerical health values
  * The Jarate/Spy Cloak/Sandman Charge Bars are right next to your ammo
  * Ubercharge meter is now toward the center of the screen.
  * Custom Scoreboard that you can remove if you want.I like it though
  * CTF HUD has been redone slightly to work on maps such as CTF BBall
  * The Sticky Charge meter is right above the health next to the sticky count
  * Freezecam shots show who killed you in the bottom of your screen not in the middle
  * Removed the item panel from spectator HUDs since it was getting in the way of screenshots and was annoying when in spectator mode
  * Tweaked the scoreboard and winpanel to look a little bit smoother and match the rest of the HUD
  * Edited the PLR and PL icons so the ammo and health wouldnt overlap so it works with all gametypes.

### **Make sure you use CL\_HUD\_MINMODE 1 before asking whats wrong with it.** ###
